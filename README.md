**Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet Smart Contract Deployment**
*Project Overview*
This project demonstrates the setup of the Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet in MetaMask and the deployment of a basic Solidity smart contract using Remix IDE.
The contract stores a message, which can be updated through a function.

**Steps**
1. Set Up Arbitrum Sepolia
2. 
  *Added Arbitrum Sepolia to MetaMask.*
  *Acquired test ETH using Chainlink faucet or Arbitrum Bridge.*


3. Write the Smart Contract

Created HelloArbitrum.sol in Remix IDE.
Developed a contract with a message variable, a constructor to set it, and a function to update it.
Compile and Deploy

Compiled the contract with the Solidity compiler.
Deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia using MetaMask.
Interact with the Contract

Verified the initial message and updated it using contract functions.
Checked contract deployment on Arbiscan.
